# Bees-image-loading-processing-and-predicting-species-from-image
In this Project, I use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. I learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline. Then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.
